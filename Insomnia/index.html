                    Experience a unique world where the perpetual night has no negative effects, 
                    but holds a mysterious secret: forcing yourself to sleep transports your consciousness to Narcole, 
                    a vibrant, otherworldly realm where sleepers thrive. As you navigate the intrigue of both worlds, 
                    uncover the sinister events threatening their coexistence. Integrate your smart watch to enhance 
                    gameplay with real-life data affecting your character's abilities, making each adventure uniquely yours. 
                    Cross-play across devices and team up with friends to tackle challenges together in this dynamic, dual-reality adventure.
